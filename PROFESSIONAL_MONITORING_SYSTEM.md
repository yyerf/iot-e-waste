## Key Features Implemented

### ðŸ”” **Smart Notification System**
```dart
// Professional notification bell with animations
- Real-time unread alert counting
- Color-coded severity indicators (Red=Critical, Orange=Warning, Blue=Info)
- Shake animation for new alerts
- Pulse animation for critical alerts
- Smart tooltip with alert summary
```

### ðŸ“Š **Advanced Monitoring Dashboard**
```dart
// Three comprehensive monitoring views:
1. Live Monitoring - Real-time battery status with vital stats
2. History - Interactive charts with voltage/charge trends
3. Analytics - Performance metrics and trend analysis
```

### âš¡ **Professional Battery Health Assessment**
```dart
// Sophisticated health algorithms:
- Voltage trend analysis over time
- Stability scoring based on voltage variance
- Decline rate calculation and prediction
- Battery condition assessment with recommendations
- Support for both 9V alkaline and 12V car batteries
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. **Update Raspberry Pi Configuration**
Your `battery_9v_monitor.py` and `battery_monitor.py` scripts are already configured to publish the correct MQTT topics that the Flutter app now monitors.

### 3. **Connect to MQTT Broker**
Run the setup script on your Raspberry Pi:
```bash
chmod +x raspberry_pi/setup_mqtt_broker.sh
./raspberry_pi/setup_mqtt_broker.sh
```

### 4. **Update Flutter App Configuration**
Update `lib/core/config/app_config.dart` with your Pi's IP address from the setup script.

### 5. **Start Battery Monitoring**
```bash
# For 9V testing
python3 battery_9v_monitor.py

# For car battery monitoring  
python3 battery_monitor.py
```

## Professional Features in Action
